# UML diagrams

A popular UML diagram tool is PlantUML. I provided a simple domain model and sequence diagram to illustrate the structure of the application.

### Installation

Use the PlantUML extension in VSCode or Notepad++. You have to ensure you have got a Java runtime as well.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk
```
I some cases you have to install graphviz as well.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install default-jre
sudo apt install graphviz
```
